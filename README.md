# About the Project

"The objective of this project was to evaluate my technical and practical expertise in using Django for backend development and React JS for frontend development."

# Solution

A user-friendly dashboard that allows for the efficient analysis of CNAB text files, enabling the storage of financial transaction information in a database of your choice. The dashboard also provides the capability to list the total number of transactions made per store and quickly view the total balance of a selected store, making it an ideal tool for managing and tracking financial data.
